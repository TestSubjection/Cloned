Oh, what fun! A Balatro Mod!

All of the changes are:
- Two pages of Jokers, including one legendary!
- One new tag!
- One new poker hand/planet card!
- That's it!

This is my first time doing any kind of proper programming, and my first time doing pixel art (if it wasn't obvious)

It's not much on its own, but it adds a little more flavor to base balatro and may be fun to see pop up if you have a million other mods on

From my experience, it does work with the newest versions of Talisman and Cryptid, but I have heard otherwise, so be careful D:

I hope you enjoy :)

If you have any bugs, suggestions, buffs, nerfs, or really anything about this mod you want to say to me, either visit the post on the Balatro Discord or DM me directly (testsubjection)
