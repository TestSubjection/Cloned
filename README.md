Oh, what fun! A Balatro Mod!

All of the changes are:
- 15 new Jokers, including one legendary!
- One new tag!
- That's it!

I might add to this in the future, but for the time being, I need to do my homework or literally anything else other than program this silly mod

This is my first time doing any kind of proper programming, and my first time doing pixel art (if it wasn't obvious)

It's not much on its own, but it adds a little more flavor to base balatro and may be fun to see pop up if you have a million other mods on

Either way, I hope you enjoy :)

If you have any bugs, suggestions, buffs, nerfs, or really anything about this mod you want to say to me, either visit the post on the Balatro Discord or DM me directly (testsubjection)
